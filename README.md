## üîß Steps Performed

1. **Initial Review**
   - Converted the dataset into table format for easier filtering.
   - Identified missing values in key fields (`Certificate`, `Metascore`, `Gross`).
   - Used boxplots to detect outliers in numeric fields like `Gross` and `IMDB_Rating`.

2. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Categorical nulls were filled with `"Unknown"`.
   - Numeric nulls were replaced with the **median**.
   - Dropped irrelevant fields like `Poster_Link`.

3. **Data Type & Format Fixes**
   - Standardized numeric formats (e.g., removing symbols from `Gross`, converting `Runtime` to minutes).
   - Ensured all numerical columns had the correct data type.

4. **Text & Category Cleanup**
   - Corrected UTF-8 encoding issues (e.g., ‚ÄúAm√É¬©lie‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAm√©lie‚Äù).
   - Cleaned textual fields using Excel functions like `TRIM`, `CLEAN`, `SUBSTITUTE`.
   - Simplified `Genre` by keeping only the primary genre.
   - Cleaned and standardized `Director` and `Stars`.
   - Removed symbols from `Overview` to prepare for future NLP.

5. **Duplicates & Structure**
   - No exact duplicates were found.
   - Added unique IDs for better referencing in SQL or BI tools.
   - Dataset was fully reorganized and structured for further analysis.
